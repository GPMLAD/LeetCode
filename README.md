# LeetCode Explorer Card

This repository is dedicated to learning data structures and algorithms through the LeetCode "Explorer Card." LeetCode is a valuable resource for sharpening your coding skills, preparing for technical interviews, and mastering various algorithms and data structures.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to track my progress as you work through the LeetCode "Explorer Card." It serves as a centralized place to document my solutions, code, and explanations for the problems you might encounter on the path to becoming a good programmer.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by problem or topic directories, each containing your solutions and explanations. Here's a sample structure:

- LeetCode/
  - array101/
    - array1.ts
    - array2.ts
    - array3.ts
    - array4.ts
    - array5.ts
  - hashTable/
    - hashTable1.ts
    - hashTable2.ts
    - hashTable3.ts
    - hashTable4.ts
    - hashTable5.ts
  - .gitignore
  - package.json
  - tsconfig.json
  - README.md

## Next steps

Please note that many of the code solutions may currently lack explanations, but I intend to progressively add detailed explanations and explore alternative approaches to solving the same problems in the coming days.

## Let's improve

If you've found any of the code or insights here helpful, or if you have suggestions, questions, or improvements to share, please don't hesitate to send me a message. I appreciate your feedback and look forward to collaborating and learning together!
